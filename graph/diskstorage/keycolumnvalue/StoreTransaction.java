 * A transaction handle uniquely identifies a transaction on the storage backend.

 * transaction. Such a transaction is identified to the JanusGraph middleware by a StoreTransaction.
 * Graph transactions rely on the existence of a storage backend transaction.
 * <p>
 * Note, that a StoreTransaction by itself does not provide any isolation or consistency guarantees (e.g. ACID).
 * Graph Transactions can only extend such guarantees if they are supported by the respective storage backend.
